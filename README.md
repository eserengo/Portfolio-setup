# ** Porfolio Setup**

## Description of the project.
This the first milestone in the process of creating my portfolio website.

The 2 sections I need to build for this project are:
the toolbar (or header):
the headline section (right after the header):

In order to lay out the elements on the page I should use Flexbox in all 2 sections.
You don't need to implement any functionality that requires JavaScript, like opening the menu or creating dropdowns.
You must stick to the design as much as possible (e.g. font, colors, images, text, margins) using the templates in Figma.
Implement the button interactions (enable, hover, etc.).
