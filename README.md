## Description of the project.

For the third milestone of your portfolio website, you will:
- Add a contact form to your portfolio and the portfolio of your coding partner.
- Make sure that you guide your users' experience in a way that helps them fill in the form without frustration.

Project requirements:
-The section you need to build for this milestone is: the contact form in the footer.
-We included a screenshot of Template 1 for reference, but you should follow the template that you chose.

Make sure that:
-Name field accepts up to 30 chars.
-Email field accepts only emails.
-Message field accepts up to 500 chars.
-All fields have placeholder text.
-All fields have the correct type.
-A user cannot submit the form if one or more of the fields is empty.
-Collect data by using the Formspree service.
-In order to lay out the elements on the page you should use Flexbox.
-You don't need to implement any functionality that requires JavaScript.
-You must stick to the design as much as possible (e.g., font, colors, images, text, margins) using the templates in Figma.
-Implement the button interactions (enable, hover, etc.).
